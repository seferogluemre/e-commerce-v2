REACT Project: E-COMMERCE Platform with DummyJSON API
this project is a fully-featured E-commerce platform built with React, utilizing DummyJSON for product data. The application presents an attractive homepage displaying a variety of products, with the option for users to view detailed product pages.

Users can filter products by category across six different sections, each displayed on its own dedicated page. The platform supports key e-commerce functionalities such as adding, updating, and removing items from the shopping cart, as well as adding or removing items from the favorites list. The app also features a sleek cart design, a favorites page, and a functional search bar that allows users to find products easily across all pages.

With a focus on a clean, modern design and user experience, this project demonstrates practical use of React components, state management, and routing for building a smooth and responsive online store.
